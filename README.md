======

My config files since *2011*, some of them were written when I've been using Linux.
Nowadays I moved to MacBook Pro.

```sh
brew install coreutils gnu-sed macvim the_silver_searcher diff-so-fancy ctags \
reattach-to-user-namespace shellcheck sshpass mosh gnupg2 asciinema fzf \
grep gawk screenfetch tflint hadolint jsonlint gnu-sed gnu-awk httpie neovim \
tidy-html5 wrk bat
```
